# Photoshop API JWT Example: Node.js

This sample app will show you how to use Adobe Photoshop APIs with JWT using Node.js.

After setting up the sample, you will have a Node.js app that:

1. Generates a JWT for your credentials
1. Obtains an access token for the JWT
1. Obtains a pre-signed url from AWS for Photoshop file in S3
1. Get the document manifest from the Photoshop file
1. Obtains a pre-signed PUT url for saving a rendition
1. Create a jpeg rendition for the Photoshop file
1. Add an adjustment layer to the file and save to another pre-signed PUT url

## Technology Used

1. Node.js and the `npm` package manager
1. OpenSSL CLI

## Prerequisites

This guide will assume that you have read the [JWT Authentication Quick Start](https://github.com/adobeio/adobeio-documentation/blob/master/auth/JWTAuthenticationQuickStart.md).

You must also have a registered integration on the Adobe I/O Console.

## Configuration

The following steps will help you get this sample up and running.

### Install Node.js packages

The `package.json` file contains a list of dependencies. Run the following command from the top level directory of the app to install these dependencies:

```bash
cd ..
npm install
```

### Set your Adobe API credentials

Set your Adobe API credentials in the file `config.json` on these lines:

```json
        "client_id": "<your API Key (Client ID)>",
        "client_secret": "<Client secret value provided by Adobe IO>",
        "private_key_file": "<location of your cert secret, e.g., private.key>",
        "audience": "<Adobe IO JWT -- value of aud, e.g., https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/c/000000000000000000000000>",
        "claim": "<Adobe IO JWT -- key, e.g., https://ims-na1.adobelogin.com/s/ent_default_sdk>",
        "issuer": "<Adobe IO JWT -- value of iss, e.g, 000000000000000000000000@AdobeOrg>",
        "subject": "<Adobe IO JWT -- value of sub, e.g., 000000000000000000000000@techacct.adobe.com>"
```

The value of `private_key_file` will be the result of the `-keyout` value from creating your private key and public certificate. E.g., `private.key`.

### Specify the location of a sample file

In `config.json`, provide an AWS S3 bucket and prefix for the sample Photoshop file.

```json
    "sample_file": {
        "s3_bucket": "<your bucket>",
        "s3_prefix": "<your sample file, e.g., test/Sunflower.psd>",
        "s3_rendition_prefix": "<location for rendition output,e.g., test/Sunflower-out-200.jpg>",
        "rendition_type": "<rendition type, e.g., image/jpeg>",
        "rendition_width": "<integer value in pixels, e.g., 200>",
        "s3_add_layer_prefix": "<location for add layer output, e.g., test/Sunflower-out-add-layer.jpg>"
    }
```

### Obtain AWS credentials

You will need an AWS account to use this sample as is. Ensure AWS credentials are available for the sample app. See [Setting Credentials in Node.js](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html)

## Usage

Now, run the app:

```bash
node index.js
```

The app will write output to the console to show progress and results. Many of the outputs are numbered so that you can match them up to the corresponding locations in the code.
